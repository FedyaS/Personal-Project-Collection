I initially had a 15 Puzzle Game Set like this:

One time, I could not solve it so I decided to try and make python solve it for me. I coded up the board and pieces and made a GUI in pygame to move around the pieces, reset the board with (r), and shuffle the board with (space). Once I finished this I wanted to implement some sort of machine learning to solve the Puzzle, but this turned out much harder as I did not have any experience with models. Later, I found out that there are algorithmic solutions to 15 and that not all configurations have a solution. However, the solution is not implemented in my code at this point in time.

The GUI looks cool though:
