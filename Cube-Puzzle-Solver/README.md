I had two sets of wooden block puzzles like these:

Each big cube is made up of 27 little cubes which are themselves split into figures. The goal is to assemble the figures together into a cube. This code takes in the coordinates of each cube (x, z, y) within each individual figure and outputs how the figures need to be placed to form the large cube. The process of inputting coordinates and then using the text output to actually assemble the puzzle pieces is somewhat burdensome so I plan on adding a 3D GUI later on.
