The classic games of Bulls and Cows has a secret set of digits from 0-9 with no repeats which a player must guess. Each guess the secret holder reveals the amount of bulls (correct digits in correct positions) and cows (correct digits in wrong positions) which were in the previous guess. This version has a command line game where the player can guess a computer's digits, riddle the computer a secret, or watch the computer play itself. The computer guessing the player's secret is a bruteforce algorithm.
